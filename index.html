<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Ben Hackl, a 19 year old human currently trying to make sense of the world while studying at UNCC.</p>
<p>I specialize in Computer Aided Design and research, which basically means I drink a lot of Red Bull and pretend to know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>When I’m not busy doing homework, you can usually find me at my robotics club while passionately arguing about how horrible CS majors are at CAD.</p>
<p>I have an irrational love for rock collecting, and I believe that Jesse Welles is the next Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>My current mission in life is to sleep, or at the very least, survive drinking 7 Red Bulls (I have to beat my previous record).</p>
<p>I’m always up for learning new things, taking on weird challenges, and maybe, just possibly, figuring out how to quit my caffeine addiction.</p>
